        "The <strong>Gilman Scholarship</strong> provided me with the <strong>financial support</strong> to enjoy my semester in <strong>Kenya</strong> without the worry of what it would cost me.
        My experience in Kenya was shaped by my <strong>incredible peers, professors, and directors</strong> who supported me <strong>academically and personally</strong> throughout
        the semester. I had the opportunity to spend a semester immersing myself in <strong>experienced-based learning, short term travel components, site
        visits, classes, and a short term internship in human rights</strong> which is a field I hope to pursue.<strong> KSP provoked intentional critical thinking</strong> 
        about every topic we studied, as well as provided students with unique <strong>experiences across the country</strong> including visiting various farms,
        sectors, and learning about the <strong>socioeconomic and political issues</strong> within each region. My time abroad <strong>wouldn't have been the same without
        Gilman</strong>, which allowed me to <strong>thrive and learn</strong> rather than be stuck worrying about <strong>financial constraints</strong>. It allowed me to <strong>
        pursue every opportunity I was excited for</strong> without the stress of it was the right decision to go abroad. I would <strong>reccommend KSP to every student</strong>, regardless of background,
        as it has <strong>something valuable to offer for anyone that goes</strong>."

        "I cant further express how <strong>grateful</strong> I am to have been selected as a <strong>Gilman Scholar</strong> and been able to experience the <strong>SLU Kenya Semester Program</strong>. 
        This scholarship has not only <strong>alleviated the financial burden</strong> associated with studying abroad but has also <strong>opened doors to a world of opportunities 
        and experiences</strong> that I would not have had otherwise. <strong>Immersing myself with Kenya's vast and rich culture</strong> while learning about the <strong>challenges locals 
        face</strong> was an <strong>eye opening experience</strong> and one I <strong>recommend for anybody studying any major</strong>. Knowing my background wasn't going to help much, I took 
        everything head on and it <strong>paid off</strong> in multiple ways fostering new <strong>connections</strong> and sparking <strong>conversations about climate and governance</strong>. I left Kenya 
        ready to take on the world of adulting with <strong>memeories and experiences that shaped me</strong> into the person I am today. Being a <strong>Gilman Scholar</strong> meant I was able 
        to <strong>connect with others like myself</strong> and harbor new connections while simultaneously not having to worry much about the <strong>financial hardships</strong> one might 
        experience studying abroad. I strongly <strong>encourage anyone pursuing studying abroad to apply for the Gilman A. Benjamin Scholarship</strong> as it <strong>supported me in my journey 
        every step of the way</strong>."
